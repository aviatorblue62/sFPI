<h2>Instructions for Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer Kit 1</h2>
</center>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

HENESFPI1 contains the key components to construct a Scanning Fabry-Perot
Interferometer suitable for looking at the longitudinal modes of a
TEM00 red HeNe laser.
<p>
The kit includes the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><b>Confocal cavity mirrors</b> - Two high quality mirrors:
<p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>S1: 99.5-99.8%@633nm with 40-45mm RoC.
 </li><li>S2: AR@633nm.
 </li><li>Diameter: 7.5-8mm.
 </li></ul>
<p>
CAUTION: Mirror coating on highly curved surface is extremely delicate.
DO NOT TOUCH.  These should be clean, requiring at most to have dust
blown off with a air bulb.  If cleaning is needed, ONLY use laser mirror
cleaning techniques!  Warranty does not cover damage to mirror surface!
I suggest NOT removing the mirrors from the lens tissue until read to
use.  They are just mirrors! :)
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b>PZT disk with center hole</b> - Requires 15-30 V to move through
 1 FSR.  A standard function generator can be used as a driver if its
 p-p voltage is adequate.  Or, construct
 <a href="http://repairfaq.cis.upenn.edu/Misc/sale/sfpidrv1.gif" class="hoverZoomLink">Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer Driver 1</a>.
 Or, add an amplifier to boost its output.  (A dual op-amp with a +/-15 V
 swing will produce up to 60 V p-p with the PZT floating, which is way
 more than enough.  See the schemtic for the driver, above.)
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Silicon photodiode</b> - A photodiode with an active
 area of around 4x8mm.  This can be connected via shielded cable directly
 to the vertical input of your scope with a 10K ohm load resistor.
 For initial setup, leave the entire photodiode uncovered.  Once there
 is a signal, installing an aperture to block all but the centeral 2-3 mm
 will improve resolution.  For low power lasers, a preamp may be required.
</li></ul>

<h3>Required Mechanical Components</h3>

A resonant cavity needs to be constructed that can be adjusted precisedly
between 40 and 45 mm between the surfaces of the mirrors while maintaining
parallelism with their centers on the same axis.  One of the mirrors must
be mounted on the PZT while the other
will be attached to a plate.  One or both mirrors must also be adjustable
in pan and tilt to align them with respect to each other.  With care, a
single adjustable mirror is adequate.
<p>
The diagram below shows just one example of a suitable design.  This is close
to the minimal complexity and cost possible using Home-Depot hardware and
scrap parts.  The other extreme is to use
Newport or Thorlabs optical breadboard components.  But if
you can afford those, you may not need to be messing around with this kit!
</p><p>
A pair of mounts for 1 inch optics would be best.  Use an adapter (available
from Thorlabs) to install one of the mirrors in its mount.  Attach this
to a linear slide on a baseplate with a micrometer adjustment.  Glue the
other mirror to the PZT center using 3 dabs of 5 Minute Epoxy.  DO NOT USE
SUPERGLUE!!!!! Once the adhesive has cured, attach the PZT to the other mirror
mount so it contacts only around its perimeter (to allow the center to move).
Use an insulating pad and fasteners if it is to electrically float.  Attach
this mount to the baseplate with a spacer (if needed) so the centers of
both mounts are precisely in-line.
</p><p>
A focusing lens with a focal point roughly in the center of the cavity
(shown in the diagram but not included in the kit) may improve performance
under some conditions but is not essential.

<h3>Initial Adjustments</h3>

The confocal cavity SFPI requires that the mirrors be spaced precisely at
their RoC, around 43 mm in this case.  So, the resonator must have some
means of fine adjustment as noted above.  Once the assembly is complete,
it's time to do "first light" with a laser!  A single longitudinal mode
(single frequency) laser is best for this as it reduces any ambiguity
in setting the cavity spacing, but a short normal HeNe (e.g., a JDSU
1508) red alignment laser can be used.  The mirror spacing (and alignment
if that is an option) should be set as close to 43 mm as can be done with
physical measurements.  (I.e.,a machinest's scale and Mark II eyeballs.)
<p>
Attach the PZT to your ramp generator and the photodiode with a 1.5K ohm
load resistor to your scope's vertical input.  (If a proper photodiode
preamp is available, that's even better!)   Trigger the scope externally
using a sync signal from the ramp generator, or the ramp if none is available.
Set up the test laser so it is aimed precisely into the center of the input
mirror.  (The optional lens should probably not be used at this time as it
may make things more confusing.)
</p><p>
Drive the PZT with a 20 to 30 V p-p ramp (or triangle) at 50 to 100 Hz.
</p><p>
With the scope's vertical sensitivity turned up, watch for any signal from
the photodiode that is syncronized to the ramp.  If your cavity distance
and mirror alignment were perfect, the result would look similar to the
photo below.

More likely, the peaks will be smeared out or composed of multiple small
blips as in the sequence of graphics below. Adjust the spacing of the
mirrors in small increments <i>Slowly</i>
and then then let it settle down.  With any movement, the display will
become quite scrambled, so be patient.  If going one way makes it worse,
go the other way. :)  If the initial cavity spacing was within about 1 mm
of being optimal, there should be only one place close by where it resolves
into a beautiful display like the one above. ;-)

<h3>(Cavity length error is approximately: +0.5 mm, +0.25 mm, +0.12 mm, +0.06 mm, +0.03 mm, 0 mm)</h3>
</center>
<p>
The entire sequence would represent a length change of a fraction of 1 mm.
The amplitude of the single peak (in this SLM example) would actually increase
by a larger amount than shown.  Some of these diagrams are
from the Toptica SFPI 100 manual, I hope they won't mind. :)
</p><p>
Using mirrors identical to the ones in the kit, I've seen a finesse at
633 nm of 500 or more, though this depends on all the stars aligning
perfectly. :)  And I can't guarantee that all samples are that good.
But expect a finesse of several hundred with reasonable care.
Performance at other wavelengths is not as good but it should still be
usable to below 594 nm (yellow HeNe) and above 650 nm.
