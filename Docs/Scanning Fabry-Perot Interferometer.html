<p><font size="5">General Remarks</font></p>
<p> It' interesting and instructive to check the longitudinal mode structure and 
  coherence length of various lasers, especially for holography use (one of my 
  long term projects is a high power DPSS ring laser, and it will be important 
  to know the mode structure). So why not try to build a scanning interferometer. 
  The idea is simple: make an interferometer with two parallel mirrors, slightly 
  transparent, and feed the laser from one side and put a photodiode at the other. 
  One of the mirrors is mounted on a piezo ceramic, and applying a triangle voltage 
  moves it periodically by a wavelength or so. Then, ideally, one can display 
  the spectrum on an oscilloscope, where x-axis = ramp voltage, y-axis=photodiode 
  current. 
</p><p>Alas, things are in practice by far not that simple - I didn't appreciate before 
  how rich this story is! For an excellent and detailed discussion see, as usual, 
  <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserlia.htm#liasfpi" target="_blank">Sam's 
  LaserFAQ</a>; there is no need to repeat it here. Let's just mention that in 
  order to have a good resolution ("finesse"), one needs dielectric 
  mirrors, with 99% or so reflectivity. In order to avoid spurious modes, one 
  needs a mode degenerate resonator, like a confocal configuration (mirror distance=radius 
  of curvature "ROC"). For having a useful scan width (free spectral 
  range, "FSR"), the radius of curvature of the mirrors should be as 
  small as possible, say a few cm. Such highly curved dielectric mirrors are very 
  hard to get as surplus, since they are not often used. This makes it difficult 
  for a hobbyist to build an SFPI in the first place. 
</p><p>But, as so often, recently eBay came to the rescue, and there were dozens of 
  highly curved dielectric mirrors available at minimal cost, originally made by Spectra 
  Physics for dye lasers. I had to get a variety of those, of course, and play 
  with them. I didn't appreciate beforehand how much fun and insights this would 
  produce! After a couple of months everything worked more or less as expected, 
  and the results are shown <a href="http://redlum.xohp.pagesperso-orange.fr/laser/spectra.html">here</a>.. 
</p><p>Note also that a scanning FP interferometer, while resolving a few Mhz of line width, spans in general only a few 100Mhz and so is most suitable for lasers with mode spacing of this size, ie, for lasers with long cavitites (at least a few tens of centimeters). For shorter cavities, and thus larger mode spacing, the display becomes ambiguous as the modes "wrap around" the display; while one can see whether there are extra modes present or not, it is hard to judge their spacing. Thus for shorter cavities, such as for DPSS laser pointers or laser diodes, a <a href="http://redlum.xohp.pagesperso-orange.fr/laser/gratingOSA.html">grating based</a> optical spectrum analyzer will be more useful for displaying the longitudinal mode spectrum. 
</p><hr>
<p><strong><a name="comments"></a></strong><font size="5">Comments on the construction 
  </font> (old)
</p><p> 
</p><ul>
  <li>The mirrors are all Spectra-Physics dye laser mirrors, which have a ROC 
    of 43mm or 50mm, just as some of the mirrors used by <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserlia.htm#liasfpi" target="_blank">Sam</a>. 
    The G3854-001 are made for red wavelengths and have a clear backside with 
    AR coating. For a confocal resonator, these mirrors give a free spectral range 
    of c/(4L) = 1.7Ghz. </li>
  For green and cyan wavelengths, I use G3845-003 and G3845-002, respectively. 
  These have ROC=50mm and yield an FSR=1.5Ghz. For more details, see <a href="http://redlum.xohp.pagesperso-orange.fr/laser/SFPI.html#mirrors">here</a>. 
  <br>
  <li>The distance between the mirrors must indeed be very precisely tuned, down 
    to a fraction of a mm - some dedicated mechanism is necessary. I used a precision 
    linear stage for that, but the whole thing was still much too unstable. It 
    should be more stable than a laser resonator, that is. I needed to rebuild 
    the setup completely.</li>
  <li> On the entrance side, there is a tunable focus element from an old spatial 
    filter. This allows to precisely translate the mirror without spoiling the 
    orientation. The mirror is otherwise fixed, and adjustment of the optical 
    axis is done by external mirrors. The other mirror is glued on a ring-shaped 
    piezo element which is attached to a finely adjustable kinematic mount. All 
    of this is mounted on a rigid, 30mm thick aluminum bracket, which by itself 
    is fixed on a very heavy lead brick. There is also a F=200mm lens that focuses 
    the beam into the cavity.</li>
  <li>I added a 400um pinhole roughly in the center of the resonator, and put 
    an iris of ca 1mm diameter before the focusing lens in front of the resonator. 
    With these is easiest to obtain a nice and clean image of the spectrum. The 
    lens is much more important than the pinhole, though. The pinhole is finely 
    adjustable by an old almost broken 3D translation stage.</li>
  <li>Adjustment is extremely delicate, Sam describes the procedure. Another good 
    description is <a href="http://hexagon.physics.wisc.edu/research/qc/internal/topticafpi100.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. 
    Even with all efforts, the gadget is not too stable. The peaks on the sope 
    screen stabilize only after a few minutes, and start racing around after I 
    have touched the resonator briefly (just from the minor amount of heat coming 
    from the hand); that doesn't make adjustment easy.... Even speaking loud in 
    the room is immediately visible on the screen. Probably stability can be improved 
    by replacing the kinematial mount by something more massive. Actively stabilizing 
    the temperature of the resonator by a TEC controller might also help. But 
    at any rate, it works well enough for hobby purposes.</li>
  <li>When the resonator is optimally adjusted, there is an enormous buildup of 
    power within the resonator (see the left pic below). This is really stunning 
    as naively, almost all of the incoming laser light gets reflected off the 
    approx 99% entrance mirror. But that's of course not true - when in resonance, 
    indeed much more power is transmitted; this is similar to a slightly coupled 
    LC circuit when in resonance (or more general physics speaking, to a weakly 
    coupled harmonic oscillator). </li>

  can be adjusted via a an old 3D stage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The piezo ceramic element that I mainly use is a 10mm dia ring with 5mm 
    hole, part number <a href="http://search-desc.ebay.com/search/search.dll?sofocus=bs&sbrftog=1&catref=C6&from=R10&satitle=SMD1005T20&sacat=-1%26catref%3DC6&bs=Search&fts=2&sargn=-1%26saslc%3D2&saprclo=&saprchi=&fsop=2&fsoo=2" target="_blank">SMD1005T20 
    </a>by <a href="http://www.steminc.com/" target="_blank">Steminc</a>, on which 
    the 7.5mm dia mirror is glued upon (after soldering the leads and blackening 
    the whole thing). For this, the 20Vpp triangular drive voltage I have from 
    my Wavetek function generator is not sufficient; I thus needed to build a 
    voltage booster circuit (the <a href="http://redlum.xohp.pagesperso-orange.fr/electronics/circuits/piezodriver.pdf" target="_blank">circuit</a> 
    has been inspired by <a href="http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/Index.cfm?AD=1&ArticleID=3789" target="_blank">this</a> 
    one). It turned out that for this piezo element, a voltage of approx 700V 
    is necessary to cover once a full free spectral range.</li>
  <li>I also use a larger version, part number <a href="http://search-desc.ebay.com/search/search.dll?sofocus=bs&sbrftog=1&catref=C6&from=R10&satitle=SMR2412T80&sacat=-1%26catref%3DC6&bs=Search&fts=2&fsop=2%26fsoo%3D2&coaction=compare&copagenum=1&coentrypage=search&sargn=-1%26saslc%3D2&saprclo=&saprchi=" target="_blank">SMR2412T80</a> 
    by <a href="http://www.steminc.com/" target="_blank">Steminc</a>, which has 
    24mm Ext. Diam x 12mm Int. Diam. x 8.0mm. It's more expensive but has at least 
    twice the responsitivity as the smaller PZT; ca 300V is enough to cover one 
    free spectral range.</li>
  <li>As I learned the hard way, piezo elements are temperature sensitive - heating 
    them above the Curie temperature, which is in the order of 200-300C, they 
    loose their polarization. So when soldering them to a base plate one should 
    be very careful, I finally used low temp solder after I realized I had damaged 
    a few piezo's by heat.</li>
  <li>As I learned the hard way too, due to the high voltage it is important to 
    keep a very good isolation between the electrodes - I had managed to get a 
    little creepage current, then heat build-up and finally sparking due to contamination 
    by glue or solder raisin, across the inner side of the ring. The resulting 
    smoke then spoiled the backside of the mirror.</li>
</ul>

  pump mirrors</font></p>
<p>As said, the availability of suitable small-radius dielectric mirrors on eBay 
  was for me the key to build an SFPI. The <a href="http://search.ebay.com/_W0QQsassZlaserman532QQhtZ-1" target="_blank">seller</a> 
  still seems to have hundreds of them. Most suitable are the G3854-001 for both 
  HeNe and 65Xnm laser diodes, because they are output couplers with nice anti-reflection 
  coating and have more ot less just the right transmission. There are many other 
  mirrors available, and fortunately Sam maintains a quite extensive <a href="http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserioi.htm#ioiclmsp" target="_blank">list</a> 
  of Spectra Physics part numbers. It turned out that the only small radius mirrors 
  for green and blue I could get hold of are the types G3845-002 and G3845-003. 
  The main drawback is that they are HR's and so have a frosted back side - something 
  with prevents a direct use in a SFPI. I first tried to polish them, to no avail. 
  On the other hand, index-matching away the frosted side by gluing a small piece 
  of 1mm thick glass on top of them does work reasonably well! Thanks to "Geso" 
  for providing a few superb anti-reflex coated glass plates for this purpose. 
  Using a Dremel diamond cutter wheel I cut out a few small pieces (like 8mm x 
  8mm) from the plates and carefully glued them on the frosted side of the mirrors 
  with optical glue - voila, the frostiness disappeared, giving rise to a nice 
  shiny back side of the dielectric mirror! However, one needs to be very careful 
  in not trapping some air bubbles or other dirt underneath, which would ruin 
  the mirror. Effectively, only a small center portion (like 1-2mm dia) will ever 
  be used, so that's not too tough to keep clean.</p>
<p>First thing with the retrofitted mirrors in hand was to measure their transmission. 
  Unfortrunately, the mirrors are not optimal, being HR's means that they tend 
  to have little transmission. Well, that's at least better than having too much 
  of it.... Here is a preliminary list of transmission data I measured:</p>

<p>Note added: I now used a pair of G3845-003 with index matched backside with 
  good success at 532nm, see below. <br>
  It also works for 514nm reasonably well with excellent resolution but with quite 
  a weak singal; not so for 488nm where the resolution is bad. 
</p><p>G3845-002 should be perfect for 488nm, but for some unknown reason, it just 
  marginally works (very weak signal).<br>
  Works perfectly for 496nm and not at all for 514nm, 532nm.</p>

<p><strong><a name="new"></a></strong><font size="5">New improved design (11/09)</font></p>
<p>My friend geso has sent me an improved design, which consists of the same mirrors and piezo elements described here, but glued onto an invar tube with fixed length (note invar has like 1/20th of the thermal expansion than aluminum). The tube is mounted in an adjustable holder to control tilt. It needs a little cut and try to figure out the proper distance between the mirrors, including of the thickness of the glue, as this needs to be very precise. But once this is done, this gives a very stable and easy to use device which has specs as good as commercial ones (less than 10Mhz resolution).</p>
<p>Here is a picture:</p>
<p><img src="./Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer_files/geso-SFPI.jpg" width="420" height="315"></p>
<p>The photodiode sits in the small tube to the left, and at the right we see the entry mirror glued onto the piezo element. Not seen is a FL=200mm focusing lens to the right, as well as an OD4 neutral density filter that suppresses backreflections to the laser. </p>
<p>In order to use such a high attenuation requires a very sensitive photodiode amplifier, and along the way I designed a dedicated circuit for it:</p>
<p><img src="./Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer_files/SFPI-ampli-1.0.png" width="583" height="365">  <a href="http://redlum.xohp.pagesperso-orange.fr/electronics/circuits/SFPI-det-1.0-18x47.brd"><img src="./Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer_files/SFPI-1.0.jpg" width="227" height="93"></a></p>
<p>It fits into a small shielded housing which takes up little footprint on the table:</p>
<p><img src="./Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer_files/SFPIamp.jpg" width="420" height="315"></p>
<p>I have some  PCBs left over and can assemble more of those amps for people in need for it.</p>
